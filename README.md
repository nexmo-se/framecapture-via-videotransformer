Video Transformers
======================

The Capture via Transformer app is a very simple application created on top of Basic Video Chat meant to get a new developer
started using Media Processor APIs on OpenTok Android SDK. For a full description, see the [Video Transformers tutorial at the
OpenTok developer center](https://tokbox.com/developer/guides/vonage-media-processor/android).

This App creates a custom transformer that can capture frames and saves it into DCIM/Screenshots
